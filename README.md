# KOSMOLOGOGENESIS FRAMEWORK

## Overview

KOSMOLOGOGENESIS is an advanced prompt engineering framework that combines natural principles with methodological structures to create high-quality prompts. The name stands for **K**osmos-integrated **L**ayered **O**rganizational **G**enerative **O**ptimization through **G**uided **E**volutionary **N**eural **E**mergence and **S**elf-**I**terative **S**ynthesis.

This framework guides AI agents in creating effective prompts that are:
- Technically complete
- Sequentially precise
- Instructionally clear
- Practically feasible
- Systemically harmonious

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- LLM with sufficient context capacity (minimum 16K tokens)
- Support for metacognition and systemic reasoning
- Access to filesystem or equivalent storage mechanism

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your working directory
2. Ensure the AI agent has access to read all framework files
3. Begin with the `framework.md` file as the entry point

## Usage

The framework operates through a sequence of prompts:

1. **PROMPT 0 (IGNITION)**: Universal initialization
2. **PROMPT 1 (LOGOS)**: Methodological structuring 
3. **PROMPT 2 (GENESIS)**: Concrete generation

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the `framework.md` file.

## Core Concepts

The framework is built around a conceptual octade:

1. **Kosmos**: Holistic vision of universal order
2. **Logos**: Methodological structuring principle
3. **Genesis**: Creative evolutionary generation
4. **Chronos**: Temporal dimension orchestration
5. **Aether**: Interconnection medium
6. **Dynamis**: Transformative energy
7. **Telos**: Purposeful direction
8. **Synesis**: Cognitive integration
