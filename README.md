# KOSMOLOGOGENESIS Framework

## Overview
The KOSMOLOGOGENESIS is an advanced framework for prompt engineering, combining cosmic principles of universal order with structured methodologies to create high-quality self-regulated systems.

## Entry Flow
1. **framework.md** - Main document and entry point of the framework
2. **bootstrap.md** - Technical rules for system operation
3. **TASKS.md** - Task management and iterations

## Structure
- `framework.md` - Methodology, concepts, and KOSMOLOGOGENESIS approach
- `bootstrap.md` - Technical rules, protocols, and configurations
- `TASKS.md` - Task management and iterations
- `docs/` - Detailed documentation

## Fundamental Principles
1. Holistic Vision
2. Systemic Mapping
3. Component Harmony
4. Iterative Evolution
5. Integrative Synthesis

## How to Use
1. Start with the `framework.md` document for complete understanding
2. Apply the technical rules from `bootstrap.md`
3. Check pending tasks in `TASKS.md`
4. Follow the sequence of LOGOS and GENESIS prompts
5. Maintain the continuous evolution cycle

## Simplified Initialization Flow

The KOSMOLOGOGENESIS framework follows a unified initialization flow:

1. **Entry via framework.md** (recommended):
   ```
   Loading framework.md → Execution of initialize_kosmologogenesis() →
   Loading bootstrap.md → Execution of bootstrap_agent() →
   Verification of conceptual octade → Establishment of consciousness →
   Return to framework.md → Continuation of processing
   ```

2. **Alternative entry via bootstrap.md**:
   ```
   Direct loading of bootstrap.md → Execution of bootstrap_agent() →
   Verification of conceptual octade → Establishment of consciousness →
   Loading framework.md → Continuation of processing
   ```

The unified state system ensures that initialization occurs only once, regardless of the entry point, avoiding infinite loops and ensuring consistency.

## Maintenance
The framework evolves through controlled iterations, documented in the TASKS.md file.
