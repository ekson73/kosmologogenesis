# Example 2: Evolutionary Technical Documentation

**Context:** Creation of documentation for an API that is constantly evolving.

**Framework Application:**

1. **Kosmos Phase:**
   - Understanding the global purpose of the API in the ecosystem
   - Identification of different user profiles and their needs
   - Mapping of API life cycles and evolution patterns

2. **Logos Phase:**
   ```markdown
   # Evolutionary Documentation Framework for API
   
   ## Principles
   - Documentation as code (versioned with the API)
   - Executable and automatically testable examples
   - Multiple layers of detail for different users
   - Built-in feedback mechanisms
   
   ## Structure
   1. Conceptual overview (for all users)
   2. Quick start guides (for new developers)
   3. Complete endpoint reference (for implementers)
   4. Architecture and design (for contributors)
   ```

3. **Genesis Phase:**
   - Implementation of automated documentation system from code
   - Creation of interactive playground for experimentation with the API
   - Development of feedback mechanisms and usage analysis
   - Integration with version control system and CI/CD
