# Practical Guide: Application of the KOSMOLOGOGENESIS Framework
# Infrastructure Migration with Crossplane and ArgoCD

---

## Context and Objective
This guide demonstrates how to apply the KOSMOLOGOGENESIS framework to plan, document, and execute the migration of AWS infrastructure to a GitOps model using Crossplane and ArgoCD.

## General Steps

### 1. Kosmos — Holistic Vision
- Inventory all current AWS infrastructure
- Map dependencies and integrations
- Define strategic migration objectives

### 2. Logos — Methodological Structuring
- Define target architecture (Crossplane + ArgoCD)
- Create incremental migration plan
- Establish success criteria and metrics

### 3. Genesis — Iterative Generation
- Generate IaC artifacts (Crossplane YAMLs, ArgoCD manifests)
- Test importing existing resources
- Validate operation and adjust
- Document each iteration

### 4. Chronos — Temporal Dimension
- Define schedule and milestones
- Plan migration windows
- Synchronize with involved teams

### 5. Aether — Communication and Integration
- Ensure continuous information flow
- Integrate tools (Git, CI/CD, monitoring)
- Facilitate collaboration between teams

### 6. Dynamis — Activation and Execution
- Execute incremental migration
- Monitor environment health
- Quickly correct deviations

### 7. Telos — Purpose and Results
- Ensure infrastructure managed via GitOps
- Reduce risks and increase automation
- Achieve defined strategic objectives

### 8. Synesis — Synthesis and Learning
- Document lessons learned
- Update processes and guides
- Plan next evolutions

## Recommendations
- Use the `framework.md` file as a continuous reference
- Update `TASKS.md` with each cycle
- Maintain living and evolutionary documentation
- Validate results with objective metrics

## Examples of Artifacts
- Crossplane definitions for VPC, EKS, RDS, S3
- ArgoCD applications to manage Crossplane resources
- Before/after architecture diagrams
- Validation checklists

## Metrics
- % of resources migrated
- Average time per iteration
- Incidents during migration
- Degree of automation achieved

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of continuous communication
- Value of evolutionary documentation
- Need for incremental validation
