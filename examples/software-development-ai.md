# Practical Example: Prompt Engineering for Software Development with AI

> **Note:** This is just an illustrative example. The KOSMOLOGOGENESIS framework is generic and can be applied to any domain, not limited to software or AI.

---

## Context
Development of an AI assistant for automatic generation of code, documentation, and tests for a RESTful API.

---

## Application of the Conceptual Octade

### Kosmos
- Holistic vision of the software lifecycle
- Integration between requirements, code, documentation, and tests
- Harmony between automation and human intervention

### Logos
- Structuring the prompt to cover:
  - Functional and non-functional requirements
  - Design patterns
  - Code conventions
  - Inline and external documentation
  - Automated test cases

### Genesis
- Iterative generation of API code
- Automatic creation of OpenAPI documentation
- Generation of unit and integration tests
- Refinement based on validations and feedback

### Chronos
- Sequencing: requirements → code → documentation → tests
- Rapid iterations with continuous validation

### Aether
- Fluid communication between generation, validation, and documentation modules

### Dynamis
- Activation of AI for creative generation and code optimization

### Telos
- Functional, documented, tested API aligned with requirements

### Synesis
- Integration of technical knowledge with end-user needs

## Initial Prompt Example

"""
You are an AI assistant specialized in RESTful API development.

Given the following requirement:

- Create an API to manage tasks (CRUD)
- Technologies: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- Requirements:
  - JWT Authentication
  - Data validation
  - OpenAPI documentation
  - Automated tests with pytest

Generate:
1. API code with CRUD endpoints
2. Data models with SQLAlchemy
3. JWT authentication configuration
4. OpenAPI documentation
5. Unit and integration tests
6. Explanatory comments in the code

Follow clean code and security best practices.
"""

---

## Iterative Process
1. **Initial generation** of code and artifacts
2. **Validation** of the generated API (execution and tests)
3. **Refinement** of the prompt to correct or improve
4. **Repetition** until defined objectives are achieved

---

## Expected Results
- Functional and secure code
- Clear and complete documentation
- Tests covering the main flows
- Ease of maintenance and evolution

---

## Observations
This example demonstrates how the KOSMOLOGOGENESIS framework can be applied to create prompts that generate complete and integrated solutions in the context of software development with AI.
