## 13. Verification Examples

**Example for Holistic Vision (Kosmos) Verification:**
Check if the prompt includes instructions to consider the impact of local changes on the system as a whole. For example: "Before implementing any change to a component, evaluate its potential impact on all interconnected components."

**Example for Metacognition (Synesis) Verification:**
Check if the prompt includes mechanisms for reflection on the process itself. For example: "After each implementation phase, conduct a reflective analysis documenting what worked, what didn't work, and why."

## Verification Procedure

1. For each section of the checklist, mark items as completed as they are verified.
2. If any item does not pass verification, document the identified issues and necessary corrective actions.
3. Do not proceed with generating the Sporos Prompt until all checklist items are completed.
4. After completing all verifications, document the completion of verification with date and observations.
