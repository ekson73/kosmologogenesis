# Versioning System - KOSMOLOGOGENESIS Framework

> **Objective:** Manage the framework's evolution in a controlled, transparent manner aligned with its principles.

---

## Versioning Convention

- **Format:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., 2.3.1)
- **MAJOR:** Disruptive changes that alter fundamental concepts or structures
- **MINOR:** New functionalities, compatible improvements
- **PATCH:** Fixes, minor adjustments, documentation

---

## Process for New Version

1. **Plan:**
   - Define scope and objectives of the change
   - Assess impact based on validation matrix
2. **Execute:**
   - Implement changes
   - Update documentation, templates, metrics
3. **Validate:**
   - Review alignment with the conceptual octade
   - Collect metrics and feedback
4. **Record:**
   - Update this file with date, author, motivation, and summary
   - Update version number
5. **Communicate:**
   - Share with users and agents
   - Update references in documents

## Version History

| Version | Date | Author | Motivation | Main Changes |
|---------|------------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| 1.0.0   | 2024-01-15 | Team  | Initial version | Base structure, conceptual octade, prompts |
| 1.1.0   | 2024-03-10 | Team  | Improvement | Initial templates, practical examples |
| 2.0.0   | 2025-04-08 | Team  | Major evolution | Full integration with principles, metrics, versioning, living documentation |

## Recommendations

- **Forks and Adaptations:**
  - Clearly document the reason and differences
  - Maintain alignment with principles whenever possible
  - Use your own version control, but record the relationship with the original version

- **Integration with Metrics and Lessons Learned:**
  - Use data to justify changes
  - Document learnings by version

- **Living Documentation:**
  - Update guides, templates, and validation matrix with each version
  - Maintain history for traceability

> **Note:** This system should continuously evolve to support the iterative improvement of the framework.
